## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Spotify Green (#1DB954) to align with the Spotify brand and create a sense of familiarity for users.
- Background color: Dark theme with a near-black (#121212) to minimize eye strain and provide a modern look.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#B3B3B3) for text and supporting elements, ensuring readability against the dark background.
- Accent color: White (#FFFFFF) for interactive elements and highlighted stats, providing clear visual cues.
- Body and headline font: 'Circular Std' or a similar modern sans-serif font for a clean and legible aesthetic.
- Use filled, minimalist icons to represent different musical categories and actions, ensuring clarity and consistency.
- Implement a modern dashboard layout with a sidebar navigation for easy access to different sections (Overview, Top Tracks, etc.). Use card-based UI elements with rounded corners and subtle shadows for a contemporary feel.
- Subtle transition animations when navigating between different views and loading data. Use smooth, unobtrusive animations to enhance the user experience.
